## Data Preprocessing

### Importing the data
I have gotten a lot more comfortable with using the `os` Python library, since importing the data 
and renaming the image files (to prevent filename ambiguity across classes) required a lot of file handling expertise.

### Train/Val/Test Split
I've opted for an 80/15/5 split . I did also consider 80/10/10 and 70/20/10 splits as they are solid options, and may even resort to them during model development if results are not great.
I used the 'split-folders' library which I discovered via this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6wbr1jJvVs&t=304s
