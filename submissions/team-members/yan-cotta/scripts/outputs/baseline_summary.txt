Baseline Summary
Updated: 2025-05-10

Baseline Metrics (Previous):
- Average F1 Score: 0.7620
- Validation Loss: 0.4870

Latest Evaluation (5-Fold Cross-Validation, 2025-05-10):
- Average F1 Score: 0.804
- Average Validation Loss: 0.409
- Fold-Specific Validation Losses: 
  - Fold 1: 0.4591
  - Fold 2: 0.3772
  - Fold 3: 0.3326
  - Fold 4: 0.5522
  - Fold 5: 0.3236

Key Observations:
- Model improved over baseline with a 0.042 increase in F1 score and 0.078 decrease in validation loss.
- Training stable across 10 epochs per fold, with train loss dropping ~60â€“65% (e.g., Fold 5: 0.8613 to 0.3315).
- Strengths: High F1 scores (>0.9) for Corn___Healthy, Rice___Neck_Blast, Wheat___Healthy, Wheat___Yellow_Rust.
- Weaknesses: Low F1 scores for Rice___Leaf_Blast (avg ~0.32) and Rice___Healthy (avg ~0.58), with significant misclassifications (e.g., Fold 5: 95 Rice___Leaf_Blast as Rice___Healthy).
- Class weights applied (e.g., 6.1203 for Potato___Healthy) to address imbalance, improving recall for some classes.

Changes Made:
- Implemented 5-fold cross-validation with updated dataset (13,024 samples).
- Trained model for 10 epochs per fold, optimizing with class-weighted loss.

Next Steps:
- Investigate feature overlap in rice classes.
- Consider data augmentation or additional samples for underperforming classes.
