# Evaluation Summary for Crop Disease Classification Model

## Overview
This document summarizes the evaluation results of a multi-class classification model for crop disease detection across corn, potato, rice, and wheat. The model was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, with metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC for each class, along with validation loss per fold.

| Potato___Late_Blight      | 0.981         | 0.992      | 0.989     | 0.995       |
| Rice___Brown_Spot         | 0.742         | 0.701      | 0.719     | 0.844       |
| Rice___Healthy            | 0.825         | 0.918      | 0.859     | 0.946       |
| Rice___Leaf_Blast         | 0.823         | 0.689      | 0.737     | 0.838       |
| Rice___Neck_Blast         | 1.000         | 1.000      | 1.000     | 1.000       |
| Wheat___Brown_Rust        | 0.993         | 0.990      | 0.992     | 0.995       |
| Wheat___Healthy           | 0.999         | 0.992      | 0.995     | 0.996       |
| Wheat___Yellow_Rust       | 0.985         | 0.998      | 0.991     | 0.998       |

## Overall Performance
- **Average Precision**: 0.937  
- **Average Recall**: 0.937  
- **Average F1 Score**: 0.936  
- **Average ROC-AUC**: 0.966  
- **Average Validation Loss**: 0.171  

## Insights
- The model performs exceptionally well for most classes, with F1 scores above 0.95 for many classes like `Corn___Healthy` and `Wheat___Brown_Rust`.
- Classes like `Rice___Brown_Spot` (avg F1: 0.719) and `Rice___Leaf_Blast` (avg F1: 0.737) show lower performance, indicating potential class imbalance or feature similarity with other rice-related classes.
- The validation loss varies across folds (0.138 to 0.196), suggesting that hyperparameter tuning or regularization could improve consistency.

## Recommendations
1. **Data Augmentation**: Increase training data or apply augmentation for underperforming classes like `Rice___Brown_Spot` and `Rice___Leaf_Blast`.
2. **Class Weighting**: Adjust class weights in the loss function to focus on minority classes.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rate and regularization to reduce variance in validation loss across folds.

## Conclusion
The model is ready for deployment with strong overall performance, but addressing the underperforming classes could further enhance its reliability in production.
